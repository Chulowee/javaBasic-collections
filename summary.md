# ArrayTest
## Test -> should_resize_array
* Q1: What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to learn the behavior of Arrays and getting and setting data. 
* The official document of this knowledge point is https://www.edureka.co/blog/java-array/.
* Q2: Why the test failed at first?
* The test failed at first because the classes are not implemented properly and codes to process the data were not present.
* Q3: Why you corrected the test that way?
* I corrected it this way so that the flow of data from classes are pushed and retrieved properly without exceeding its limit or capacity.
* Q4: Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No.

# CollectionsTest

* Q1: What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is To learn more about iterators and how to customize your own one. Also being able to utilize it in a loop, get and set their values. And also about different types of Collections such as Lists and Sets. 
* The official document of this knowledge point is https://www.edureka.co/blog/java-collections/.
* Q2: Why the test failed at first?
* The test failed at first because the classes are not implemented properly and codes to process the data were not present.
* Q3: Why you corrected the test that way?
* Used some loop with the state of .hasNext and increasing the value of the rundown. 
* Completed the execution of the Sequence document by setting an integer of the file and end factors, additionally altered the hasNext capacity to check if the record is not exactly the end variable just as altering the following capacity to increase the file. 
* Answered Amy, Bob, and Carl as the order of the iterator added but then removed Juliet so it retained its order. 
* Completed the execution of the DistinctIterable class by changing the constructor, so that it would make another set and iterate, since a HashSet won't have copy information so it will just have unmistakable qualities in it. 
* Answered 0, 1, 2, 10, 11 as whatever happens to the information in the sublist will mirror every one of the information on the first list.
* Q4: Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No.
